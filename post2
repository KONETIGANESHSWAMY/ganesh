<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>UK charitable organisation the Graduate Fashion Foundation has opened applications for a new fashion design competition in collaboration with sustainable fashion start-up Untagged. All final year students enrolled in a Bachelor programme at a Graduate Fashion Week Member University can participate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to participate in the competition, students from GFW UK and international member universities must design and create a physical outfit made from second-hand clothing and no virgin materials.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, students must submit a description of the garment, documenting the creation process from the second-hand clothing materials into the final look.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The documentation should be visual and include photographs as well as a written description on Powerpoint slides. The student must also explain the concept behind the garment and what they envision it to look like if it is selected by the jury to be turned into an NFT.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order for the garment to be considered, it should be appropriate for the female or gender-neutral consumer to wear and fit a UK size 10 model (EU size Small).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Application must be sent in by a tutor, not the student, at one of the GFW member universities in the UK and internationally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Educators are encouraged to only submit the applications of their top 5 students.</p>
